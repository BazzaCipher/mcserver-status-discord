/**
 * Nicknaming servers: a challenge
 *
 * Servers are many, some even temporary, but something which must be tackled
 * is constant referencing. For one, I use my own servers a lot, and sometimes
 * I even have naked IPs which may be insecure. As such, I want to have a) nicknames
 * for some servers and b) timings for servers.
